## **Introduction**

Customer churn is a critical metric that can significantly impact a company's bottom line. In the "Customer Churn Prediction" project, we leverage machine learning with Python to predict potential churn, enabling proactive strategies for customer retention. The predictive model, built using Random Forest algorithm, identifies key factors that contribute to customer attrition.

The insights derived from the model are seamlessly integrated into a dynamic Power BI dashboard. This interactive dashboard provides stakeholders with a comprehensive view of churn trends, key drivers, and actionable insights. With intuitive visualizations and filtering options, users can explore the data in depth, allowing for informed decision-making and targeted retention strategies.

This project demonstrates the effective use of machine learning in solving real-world business challenges and highlights the importance of data visualization in translating complex insights into strategic actions.
